Meesho is an online shopping website that offers various products such as shoes, shirts, sarees, etc. When a user visits the website, they will see a landing page with a navigation bar, search input, sign-up, and cart icons. The homepage displays a wide range of products that users can search by name. To access the website's features, users need to sign up by clicking the sign-up button. They will then be redirected to the sign-up page, where they can enter their mobile number and password. After signing up, users will be redirected to the home page, where they can browse different products. By clicking the "add to cart" button, a selected product will be added to the cart, which users can access by clicking on the cart icon. Inside the cart page, users can adjust the quantity of products or delete them. Once finished, users can simply log out. Additionally, an admin page has been implemented. To access the admin page, the password is set as "1234". Both users and admins can go to the admin page, where the admin can add various products to the main home page.
